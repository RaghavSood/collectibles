### BTCC - Bitcoin China Mint

From 2016 to 2018, BTCC Mint produced and sold physical bitcoins in a variety of different physical formats, from coins to blocks to poker chips.

Co-founded by Bobby Lee, BTCC operated a mining pool, exchange, and mint. The mint produced unique physical collectibles that were funded directly from the Bitcoin Block Subsidy from blocks mined by the BTCC pool.
