Crypto Imperator's 2017 Moon Coin edition is unique, containing 38.44 coins.

It is not publicly known what the 0.44th of a coin is, as the winner of the original sale did not disclose the nature of the coin.

Each coin is made of .999 fine silver, with a diameter of 27mm and a width of 2mm. The coins weigh 10 grams each.

Each coin is funded with 0.02003 BTC, which reads moon when read sideways.
