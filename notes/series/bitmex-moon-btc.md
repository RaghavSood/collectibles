In January 2024, BitMEX partnered with Astrobotic to send 1 BTC to the Moon[^1], quite literally. A physical coin was launched to the Moon on Peregrine-1[^2].

Unfortunately, the missing suffered a catastrohpic failure, and the lander was forced to deorbit, burning up in the atmosphere. The Moon BTC coin never reached the moon, and is lost.
