The Gearing Bitcoin Coin Set by Crypto Imperator is a limited run of 21 sets, each consisting of two coins.

The set was originally offered for sale on Bitcointalk[^1], where 19 sets were sold. Serials 12 and 14 were not publicly sold.

Each of the two coins in the set has a face value of 0.05 BTC. The hologram on the back of the coin contains the firstbits, as well as the serial number of the set.
