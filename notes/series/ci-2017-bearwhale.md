The 2017 BearWhale coin by Crypto Imperator commemorates the slaying of the BearWhale, a large seller who sold 30,000 Bitcoins on the Bitstamp exchange in 2014. Eventually, over the course of six hours, the entire sell wall was bought up and the price recovered.

The commemorative coin is made of .999 fine silver and has a diameter of 40mm, a width of 3mm, and a weight of 1 Troy Oz. The denomination of each coin is 0.03 BTC. Only 30 coins were minted, each numbered 1-30.
