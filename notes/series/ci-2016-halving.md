This halving set of 1/2 oz silver coins commemorates the 2016 halving of the Bitcoin block reward. The first 25 coins are gold plated, while the remaining 75 are plain silver.

Each coin is funded with 0.125 BTC, in line with the reduction of the block reward from 25 to 12.5 BTC.

Each coin has a diameter of 30mm and a thickness of 2mm, composed of .999 fine silver. The front features a Bitcoin B on the left half of the face, and a 2016 halving commemorative text on the right half. The back features Crypto Imperator's Rocket To-The-Moon holograms, covering a private key. The hologram sticker has a window to display the firstbits, and the coin's serial laser etched below the window.
