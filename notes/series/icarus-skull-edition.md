The Icarus Skull Edition cards are a set of 21 serialized cards manufactured by Icarus. The design was created in collaboration with jayce.

The cards are a reference[^1] to a controversial topic by greenpeace on the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.

All 21 cards were sold on Bitcointalk via auction as Buyer Funded. There is no stamped or face value for these cards.
