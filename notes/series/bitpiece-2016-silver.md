BitPiece are a series of coins minted by Bitcointalk user miffman in 2016. A total of 115 brass coins were planned for. Of these, 10 were silver plated.

Each coin has a face value of 0.25 BTC and comes with a hologram-protected private key. Coins sold as funded contain the firstbits of their address. Coins sold as unfunded contain the word "EMPTY!!!" in place of the firstbits.
