BTCC produced a total of 16 Artist Proof blocks, each containing a full block reward from the second halving era. The artist proofs were mined in 2015, predating the 2016 general release of the BTCC Blocks.

Each block is annotated with two stars to represent the second halving era. The blocks are made of titanium, and were sold along with a wooden etui box.
