The Coint Co New Lydian coins are an artistic reinterpretation of the ancient Lydian coins.

The coins themselves deviated from what a typical collectible Bitcoin functions as - they contain no serials, no holograms, and no private keys.

Instead, the 0.0002 BTC loaded on each "coin" is actually loaded into the accompanying certificate of authenticity, which contains a 12-word BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase.

**As such, all items within this collection should be considered compromised. The coins themselves have no BTC value, and anybody who has ever viewed the accopmanying certificate of authenticity would be able to retain access to the BTC value, even if the coin is subsequently sold with the certificate.**

The stated mintage of the coins is 500, but only 103 have been funded from the Coint Co address. It is unknown how many were minted in total.

Two variants purpotedly exist - a full silver one, and one with gold plating. It is unknown whether the stated mintage of 500 is for each variant, or the total mintage of both variants combined.
