The 10,000 bit (0.01 BTC) Bitcoin coin was Crypto Imperator's first Bitcoin release, following the 10,000 DOGE coin.

With a total mintage of 500, the first 100 coins were serialized from 1 to 100. The remaining 400 were sold without serials. Addresses for 345/400 of those coins are known, while the rest may have been sold as DIY or buyer funded.

Each coin is made of Zinc Alloy, from a 39mm round with a 3mm thickness.

Being a pre-fork coin, funded coins contain not only the 0.01 BTC, but also an equivalent amount of BCH and other forks.
