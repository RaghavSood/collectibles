### 10th Anniversary Note

The Polymerbit "10 Years Of Bitcoin" commemorative note was a joint project between [Polymerbit](https://collectible.money/creator/polymerbit), [Xprim777](https://collectible.money/creator/xprim777), and [Yogg](https://collectible.money/creator/yogg). Announced[^1] on Bitcointalk, the note was produced in a limited run of 21 pieces, each with a unique serial number.

The note was loaded with 50 USD worth of BTC, as per the exchange rate on the 3rd of January 2019.

As per Polymerbit[^2], this note's keys should be considered compromised as they were generated by Yogg, who subsequently stole funds from his own Coldkey projects and did not destroy the keys as he claimed he had.
